# NASDAQ_PRICE_PRICE

Ever Heard of Acronym FAANG? if not, here it is

-Facebook -Apple -Amazon. -Netflix -Google

A lot of people were using the FAANG, infact an index was created for the same to enhance their trading strategies.

The idea behind this project is something simnilar, I've used the top 10 companies from Nasdaq 100 to predict future closing prices of the NASDAQ 100 Index

Top 10s Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, Netflix, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet Class A, Alphabet Class C, Microsoft.

The reason being was the strong co-relation between the top 10 and NASDAQ as noted below,

With the use of various machine learning models and different variables as features such as the Open, High, low, and the top 10, I have predicted the closing prices for NASDAQ 100 within a given period.

Our hypothesis is to create a tactical (short-term) financial model that is able to predict future prices of the Nasdaq 100 Index over the next 10 days. By making predictions, an investor can use the model to buy (long) or sell (short) the Nasdaq Index via using Index ETFs or Index options (writing calls or puts).
